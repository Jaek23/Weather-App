# Weather App
Weather App

## Description 
This is the sixth challenge for the UTA boot camp. This project was created to utilize server-side API to get information and to make an informative webpage using the information provided by the API. This project was focused on using the OpenWeather API to create a webpage where a user can enter a city and get the current and the next 5-day weather forecast. 

## Usage 
When the user opens up the weather app, the user can search for a city with the provided search bar on the left side of the webpage. Once the user has entered a city and clicked the search button, the current weather of that city will be displayed with the 5-day forecast right below.
